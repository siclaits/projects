How can I, over the next month, determine the top three factors that affect the customer rating of London Airbnb listings based on their attributes to maximize revenue for hosts and provide value for guests? 
 

Context: Airbnb is the most popular alternative to hotel accommodations, so understanding the factors that affect customer ratings can help hosts to optimize their listings and increase overall value for their guests. However, with a 5-star non-anonymous rating system comes major limitations in separating great listings from average listings. Via the development of a model to determine how much each attribute of a listing contributes to the listing’s overall rating, we can identify what the most important factors are. 

Criteria for Success: The criteria of success for this project can be measured by the accuracy of the manufactured prediction model and the identification of the most important factors affecting Airbnb ratings within a month’s time constraint. 

Scope of Solution Space: Data available on Airbnb listings, reviews, and pricing for London listings where guests stayed over the weekend. 

Constraints within Solution Space: As the data itself is from 2019, it is possible that expectations from customers may have changed significantly since the onset of COVID-19. So, there remains a question of whether or not the data will still be relevant upon project completion and can be used by stakeholders. 

Stakeholders: Potential Airbnb customers, Airbnb customers, Airbnb hosts 

Key data sources: Dataset of London listings where guests stayed over the weekend.
